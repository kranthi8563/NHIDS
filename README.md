In today's ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, the detection and prevention of network and host 
intrusions have become paramount. This research presents a groundbreaking network-host 
intrusion detection system named NHIDS-Net, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques 
on the NSL-KDD dataset. The study begins with an introduction to the escalating threats in the 
cyberspace and the crucial role intrusion detection systems (IDS) play in safeguarding digital 
assets. The conventional intrusion detection systems are then explored, focusing on their 
limitations, such as high false positive rates, low accuracy in detecting novel attacks, and limited 
adaptability to evolving attack patterns. The proposed system, NHIDS-Net, overcomes these 
drawbacks by harnessing the power of deep learning algorithms, specifically deep neural networks 
(DNNs). The architecture is meticulously designed to enhance feature extraction from both 
network and host data, providing a holistic approach to intrusion detection. The NSL-KDD dataset, 
a widely recognized benchmark for intrusion detection research, serves as the foundation for 
training and evaluating NHIDS-Net. The system's ability to adapt and generalize to previously 
unseen attack scenarios is thoroughly investigated, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating 
false positives and accurately identifying novel intrusion patterns. The research delves into the 
technical intricacies of NHIDS-Net, explaining the design choices, hyper parameter tuning, and 
the rationale behind incorporating both network and host-based features for a comprehensive 
intrusion detection solution. The experimental results showcase the system's superior performance 
compared to traditional methods, with a detailed analysis of its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score across various attack categories. Furthermore, NHIDS-Net's real-time capabilities and 
scalability are discussed, highlighting its potential for deployment  in large-scale and dynamic 
network environments.
